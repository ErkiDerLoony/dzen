This program gathers status information about local and remote computers and outputs it in a format suitable for consumption by the dzen2 program [1].

To run the program first do

  $ make

and then call it e.g. with

  $ ./dzen++ -r server1,server2 | dzen2

Make sure you can login to server1 and server2 via ssh without a password. Otherwise things might get annoying.
